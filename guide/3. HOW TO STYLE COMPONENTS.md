The first part of the styling system is the theming system, that they have set up for us.
There are a lot of benefits to the styling system that material ui uses, so we are going to go
over these as well.

The PALETTE: is a way to manage the colours used in the application, but material ui takes
a step further than that, and provides some fascinating functionality for us.
Look at the material ui documentation and find out how to set up the styling system [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/).
JSS: Js to Css compiler. Interesting solution that allows us to write all of our styles withing our component.
Run npm install @material-ui/styles to install the dependencies for styling.
