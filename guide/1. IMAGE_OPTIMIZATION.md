Image optimization is a great topic to start with. It really plays an impact on the performance of the application.

First rules of I.O. is always use SVG, when possible. (SCALABLE VECTOR GRAPHIC)
- SVG format is naturally responsive, they do allow to scale them without reduce the quality.
- They are very small (just some bytes) files.
- They are customizable (easy to manipulate proprieties such color, height and width providing own props.) This gives us a lot more control over the images as if they were actual icons and even enables us to do cool things.

If not allowed to use SVG, JPG/PNG are the other valid options to use.

A live demonstration on difference between having good and bad optimization for images can be done using [Google page Speed Insight's](https://pagespeed.web.dev/). They provide suggestion on how to improve the score of the site.
[Tiniyjpg](https://tinyjpg.com/) is a really easy site to reduce file storage capacity.
[SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) is essentially the same thing, drop the SVG file and produce an optimized version.
