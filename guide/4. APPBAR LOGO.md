Import the logo from the directory into the Header.js. And right where the Typography placeholder was
put the logo into a img tag. The little gap is easily inspect able in the dev tool. The padding is "bigger" and we 
have to find a way to remove the extra. This can easily be done just adding in the toolbar component the prop disableGutter. Material UI
again gives us a really easy way to fix problems.
Now the logo is a little big, but this is easily fixable: in the img tag add the className prop and assign it to {classes.logo}.
Logo is not in the makeStyle which we created, so we add the logo style, and we set the height of the image to "7em". Now the 
"Hi" text is not displaying. What we need to do is add a little of extra height into the toolbar margin class (toolbarMargin) and add the style 
marginBottom: "3em" to offset the extra height of the logo. Job done
