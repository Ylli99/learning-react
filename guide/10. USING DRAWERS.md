# [Drawers](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/)
Navigation drawers provide access to destinations in your app. Side sheets are surfaces containing supplementary content that are anchored to the left or right edge of the screen.
Navigation drawers (or "sidebars") provide access to destinations and app functionality, such as switching accounts. They can either be permanently on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon.

During the implementation of the drawer we also get in touch with the [List component](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-list/). One of the most powerful component in MUI.
