The header is present in every page, sort of backbone. It's going to be the starting point of this project.
To build that header, we are going to get familiar with material ui appbar component. This component provides the basic
functionality that you would expect out of a header, such as spanning the entire length of the screen, and always staying
at the top.

Start having a look at the [material ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-app-bar/) site, under components/surfaces/appbar.
Create a new folder in 'src' and name it 'components'. Move App.js in it and create a new folder named 'ui' withing the folder
'components'. This way of organizing files help us and extern people orientate into our project.
In 'ui' we create a js file named 'Header' which will be our header of the project. We import AppBar and Toolbar from react, and we use
these elements to create our personalized Header. Note that the AppBar element has some prebuilt proprieties, like the one defined, position='fixed' that prevents
our Header from moving of position. Try to see what happens using position='static'.
After that, in App.js, we introduce this new element with the opening and self-closing tag.

AppBar can be personalized in different ways: scroll down [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-app-bar/) and open the code of the desired
AppBar and try to replicate it.
